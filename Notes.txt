I built and ran the project before implementing any of the tasks.
While testing the Employee APIs with ThunderClient (Postman-esque VSCode extension),
I noticed that some of the log messages didn't match the received request.

The current implementation of ReportingStructureService depends on EmployeeService.
An alternative could be to delegate the logic for computing a ReportingStructure to
EmployeeService. A ReportingStructure is just data that can be derived from an employee. 
This new approach would remove the service-to-service dependency that currently exists.
